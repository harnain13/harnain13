# Hi there! Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me
Hi, I'm Harnain Kaur Sardarni, a versatile Data Professional with 3+ years of experience in Data Engineering, complemented by a strong foundation in Data Science. I specialize in architecting scalable data pipelines, real-time streaming applications, and end-to-end ETL solutions across cloud and on-premise environments, while also possessing expertise in predictive modeling, machine learning, and data analysis. Leveraging tools like Python, Spark, Kafka, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), I am passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and building the robust infrastructure required to support data-driven innovation. I've successfully tackled diverse projects, from optimizing nutrient management in hydroponics and predicting obesity levels with advanced algorithms to integrating ML models into production pipelines for real-time analytics. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can combine my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to create impactful solutions. Let's connect and explore how we can leverage data to achieve transformative results.
